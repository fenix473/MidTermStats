                Scope of this research is human labour and how it is affected by the rise in technologies such as AI and robotics.
                <ul className="cyber-list">
                    <li>Measure the productivity trends of humans and AI.</li>
                    <li>Compare productivity of these groups.</li>
                    <li>Determine whether their productivity complements or competes.</li>

                <span className="cyber-subtitle">1.2 Why this matters today</span> <br />
                In 2025 we find ourselves in a world where mass media hypes AI and related technologies as a major innovation. On par with the Industrial revolution, which had allowed great productivity increase and caused serious social turmoil. Both this events are partially happening today, technological advancement marvels happen, so does AI is blamed for gigantic layoffs. 32% of companies already claim to automate some processes with AI.

                These numbers are probably to increase in the future, and so increases the pressure on traditional labor. Eventually, if human labor is being less effective than AI work, there is no need for human labor. Workforce is left alone in finding their new place in a productive society in order to continue receiving their wages. Furthermore, given AI is increasing in productivity from the bottom. It has meaningful applications often in less highly qualified tasks like call centers and customer service jobs. Such people being replaced by AI, are being the toughest to reintegrate to a productive society. When people are losing their living, this is a question of social justice and a deep ethical question we have not solved yet.
